Semantic HTML tags provide several benefits, including improved accessibility for users with **<mark>disabilities, better search engine optimization (SEO)</mark>**, improved maintainability of code, and future-proofing. By using descriptive tags, **<mark>you can make it easier for others to understand the structure and purpose of your web pages</mark>**, and adapt to new technologies and devices in the future.

## What are Semantic Elements?

**A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.** Examples of non-semantic elements: &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; - Tells nothing about its content. Examples of semantic elements: &lt;form&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, and &lt;article&gt; - Clearly defines its content.

### Semantic Elements in HTML

While many websites use non-semantic HTML code like &lt;div id="nav"&gt;, &lt;div class="header"&gt;, and &lt;div id="footer"&gt; to define navigation, header, and footer sections, HTML also provides semantic elements that can be used for this purpose. Semantic elements like &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; have a clear and specific meaning, which can improve the accessibility, maintainability, and search engine optimization (SEO) of a web page. By using semantic HTML, we can create web pages that are easier to understand, maintain, and use for both humans and machines.

### Some examples of semantic HTML tags include:

&lt;header&gt;: Defines a header section for a document or section

&lt;nav&gt;: Defines a section of navigation links

&lt;main&gt;: Defines the main content of a web page

&lt;article&gt;: Defines a self-contained article or piece of content

&lt;section&gt;: Defines a section of content

&lt;aside&gt;: Defines content that is tangentially related to the main content

&lt;footer&gt;: Defines a footer section for a document or section Using semantic HTML tags can make your code more readable and maintainable, as well as improve the accessibility and usability of your web pages.

# **üéØ** Conclusion**!**

To summarize, while it is common for websites to use non-semantic HTML code like &lt;div&gt; to define different parts of a web page, using semantic HTML elements like &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; provides several benefits. These benefits include improved accessibility, maintainability, and search engine optimization. By using semantic HTML, we can create web pages that are easier to understand and use, both for human users and machines like search engines and screen readers.
