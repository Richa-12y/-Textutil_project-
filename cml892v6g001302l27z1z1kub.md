Today’s problem is one of those classic string questions that looks simple but checks whether you **actually understand how strings work**, especially **spaces**.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement (In My Own Words)

You are given a string that may contain:

* Letters (upper & lower case)
    
* Numbers
    
* **Leading spaces**
    
* **Trailing spaces**
    
* **Multiple spaces between words**
    

👉 A **word** is any sequence of characters separated by spaces.

### Task:

* Reverse the **order of words**
    
* Remove extra spaces
    
* Keep **only one space** between words
    

---

## ✨ Example

```plaintext
Input:  " amazing   coding skills "
Output: "skills coding amazing"
```

---

## 🤔 What I Thought at First (Beginner Honest Thought)

> “Bas split kar lo, reverse kar lo, join kar lo.”

But then I realized:

* What about extra spaces?
    
* What if interviewer says “don’t use split”?
    
* Am I really understanding DSA, or just using shortcuts?
    

So I learned **two ways** 👇

---

# ✅ Approach 1: Using In-Built Methods

### 💡 Idea

1. Remove extra spaces
    
2. Split words
    
3. Reverse them
    
4. Join back with one space
    

---

### 💻 Code (In-Built Way)

```js
function reverseWords(s) {
    s = s.trim();                // remove leading & trailing spaces
    let words = s.split(/\s+/);  // split by one or more spaces
    words.reverse();             // reverse word order
    return words.join(" ");      // join with single space
}
```

---

### 🧠 Walkthrough with Example

Input:

```plaintext
" amazing   coding skills "
```

**Step 1 – trim()**

```plaintext
"amazing   coding skills"
```

**Step 2 – split(/\\s+/)**

```plaintext
["amazing", "coding", "skills"]
```

(`\s+` means one or more spaces)

**Step 3 – reverse()**

```plaintext
["skills", "coding", "amazing"]
```

**Step 4 – join(" ")**

```plaintext
"skills coding amazing"
```

---

### ⏱ Complexity

* **Time:** O(n)
    
* **Space:** O(n)
    

✔ Interview acceptable  
✔ Real-world friendly  
❌ Uses in-built methods

---

# ✅ Approach 2: Pure DSA Way (No split, No reverse)

Now comes the **real DSA learning part** 💪  
This is the approach interviewers love when they say:

> “Can you do it without using in-built functions?”

---

## 💡 Core Idea (Think Like a Beginner)

* Start from the **end of the string**
    
* Skip spaces
    
* Pick one word at a time
    
* Add it to result
    
* Repeat
    

---

## 💻 Code (Pure DSA)

```js
function reverseWords(s) {
    let result = [];
    let i = s.length - 1;

    while (i >= 0) {
        // Step 1: Skip spaces
        while (i >= 0 && s[i] === ' ') {
            i--;
        }

        if (i < 0) break;

        // Step 2: Capture a word
        let j = i;
        while (j >= 0 && s[j] !== ' ') {
            j--;
        }

        // Step 3: Push word
        result.push(s.substring(j + 1, i + 1));

        // Step 4: Move pointer
        i = j - 1;
    }

    return result.join(" ");
}
```

## 🔍 LINE-BY-LINE WALKTHROUGH

Let’s take the same example:

```plaintext
s = " amazing   coding skills "
```

---

### 🔹 Line 1

```js
let result = [];
```

👉 This array will store words **in reverse order**

---

### 🔹 Line 2

```js
let i = s.length - 1;
```

👉 We start from the **last character**  
👉 `i` points to the end of the string

---

### 🔹 Main Loop

```js
while (i >= 0) {
```

👉 Keep moving left until string ends

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Skip spaces

```js
while (i >= 0 && s[i] === ' ') {
    i--;
}
```

👉 If there are:

* trailing spaces
    
* multiple spaces
    

We **ignore them**

Example:

```plaintext
" amazing   coding skills␣␣"
                        ↑ i
```

We move `i` left until it hits `'s'`

---

### 🔹 Safety Check

```js
if (i < 0) break;
```

👉 If string has only spaces → stop

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Capture the word

```js
let j = i;
while (j >= 0 && s[j] !== ' ') {
    j--;
}
```

👉 `j` moves left until it finds a space  
👉 Now we know:

* word starts at `j+1`
    
* word ends at `i`
    

Example:

```plaintext
skills
^^^^^^
j+1    i
```

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Extract word

```js
result.push(s.substring(j + 1, i + 1));
```

👉 Extracts:

```plaintext
"skills"
```

👉 Push into result:

```plaintext
["skills"]
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Move pointer

```js
i = j - 1;
```

👉 Jump before the space  
👉 Continue for `"coding"` and `"amazing"`

---

### 🔹 Final result array

```plaintext
["skills", "coding", "amazing"]
```

---

### 🔹 Join result

```js
return result.join(" ");
```

👉 Output:

```plaintext
"skills coding amazing"
```

## 🧪 Edge Cases Handled

✔ Leading spaces  
✔ Trailing spaces  
✔ Multiple spaces  
✔ Single word  
✔ Only spaces  
✔ Numbers & mixed case

All covered ✅

## ⏱ Complexity (Pure DSA)

* **Time Complexity:** O(n)
    
* **Space Complexity:** O(n)

## 🤝 Which Approach Should You Use?

| Situation | Use This |
| --- | --- |
| Learning DSA | Pure DSA approach |
| Interview | Explain both |
| Real projects | In-built approach |

## 🌱 Day 26 Learning (From My Heart)

> Today I learned that  
> **DSA is not about avoiding shortcuts**  
> It’s about understanding what happens **behind** those shortcuts.

If you can explain this problem **line by line**,  
you are no longer “just solving” —  
you are **understanding** 💙
