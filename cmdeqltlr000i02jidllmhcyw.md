**Konnichiwa, minna-san!**  
It’s Day 2 of my Japanese learning journey, and I’m so happy to share my progress with all of you!

Yesterday, I had covered Hiragana characters from the **A (あ)** series to **SA (さ)** series.  
Today, I got around 30 minutes — not a lot, but enough to make progress. And that’s what matters: **small steps every day.**

---

### 📖 What I Covered Today

I focused on the next sets of Hiragana:  
➡️ **TA (た) series**

* た (ta)
    
* ち (chi)
    
* つ (tsu)
    
* て (te)
    
* と (to)
    

➡️ **NA (な) series**

* な (na)
    
* に (ni)
    
* ぬ (nu)
    
* ね (ne)
    
* の (no)
    

➡️ **HA (は) series**

* は (ha)
    
* ひ (hi)
    
* ふ (fu)
    
* へ (he)
    
* ほ (ho)
    

These letters are starting to feel familiar, and writing them over and over helps a lot! Hiragana has a rhythm — it’s like dancing with a pen 🖋️💃

### 🗣️ Words & Phrases I Learned Today

I also started learning basic Japanese words that are commonly used in daily conversations:

| English | Japanese (Romanji) | Japanese (Hiragana) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hello | Konnichiwa | こんにちは |
| Thank you | Arigatou | ありがとう |
| Excuse me | Sumimasen | すみません |
| Sorry | Gomen nasai | ごめんなさい |
| Goodbye (formal) | Sayonara | さようなら |
| See you | Mata ne | またね |
| Meal / Rice | Gohan | ごはん |
| Bread | Pan | パン *(Katakana)* |

And a small **self-introduction** I’m practicing:

> わたし は Richa です。  
> (Watashi wa Richa desu.)  
> ➤ I am Richa.

### ⏳ What I Realized Today

Even if it’s just 30 minutes — it’s **consistency** that matters.  
It’s okay if I can’t learn everything in one day. I’m happy that I’m slowly connecting words and sounds. I even caught myself saying “Arigatou” instead of “Thank you” naturally 😄

The more I learn, the more I love the culture. And I’m also realizing how respectful and poetic Japanese is. Every word has intention.
