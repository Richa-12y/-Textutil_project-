Hey readers 📚,  
This morning, I finally found a quiet moment just for myself. No debugging, no rush to open a laptop for coding. Just peace, chai, and a book.

So I thought—let’s write something from the heart today.  
And what better book to talk about than one filled with **stories**? Real, raw, human stories that feel like they’ve come straight from the corners of our own lives.

Today’s blog is a personal review of a book that touched me deeply:  
📖 **“Wise and Otherwise: A Salute to Life” by Sudha Murty**

## 🧒 Why This Book Took Me Back to Childhood

Before I tell you about the book itself, let me take you back to a simpler time…

Growing up, we didn’t have the luxury of buying new books every month. But I still managed to read—because I *wanted* to.

I had a neighbor who used to read **Champak**, **Nandan**, **Chacha Chaudhary**—and I’d literally wait for him to finish so I could borrow them. Sometimes I didn’t even wait; I’d just run to his home and ask, “Tumne book padh liya kya?,mujhe chaiye tha, mai padh kar wapas kar dugi” 😄

And of course, my grandparents were the *original storytellers*—the kind who could turn even a glass of water into a life lesson.

Since then, stories have always felt like home to me.  
That’s why **this book felt so personal**.  
Because “Wise and Otherwise” is not just a book.  
It’s **51 small windows into real Indian lives**—and each story teaches you something without shouting it.

## 📝 What Is “Wise and Otherwise” About?

It’s a collection of 51 real-life stories Sudha Murthy experienced first-hand or came across during her time working with the Infosys Foundation.

These aren’t made-up or over-dramatized. They’re *simple yet powerful*, just like life itself.  
Stories of kindness, betrayal, gratitude, greed, love, and everyday wisdom that make you stop, smile, or even tear up a little.

The beauty?  
👉 You can read one story a day.  
👉 No heavy commitment.  
👉 And every story leaves you with something real to carry forward.

## 💫 A Few Stories That Stayed With Me

There are so many good ones, but here are a few that deeply touched me:

### 🌸 *“A Lesson in Life from a Beggar”*

Sudha Murthy meets a beggar who gives her one of the most powerful lessons in *dignity and gratitude*.  
It’s not always the rich who are generous.  
Sometimes the people who have the least are the ones who give the most.

> 💡 It reminded me that *how* you give matters more than *what* you give.

---

### 🧓 *“Three Thousand Stitches”* (Okay, this one's from another book, but equally relevant!)

She writes about rehabilitating women from the Devadasi system—and how difficult, yet important, the journey was. The title refers to the embroidery work done by the women to reclaim their dignity.

> 💡 We often judge others without knowing their story. This book reminds us to listen before we label.

### 🧓 **Aged Father Abandoned in an Old-Age Home**

Sudha Murthy recounts meeting a man at an old-age home who shockingly claimed the elderly man with him was a homeless stranger—and his father. He abandoned his dad there, only returning after his death to claim money from the old man's belongings. This story is a stark reminder of how **we can lose humanity even within our own families**.
