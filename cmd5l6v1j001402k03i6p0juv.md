Hey readers 📚,  
This morning, I finally found a quiet moment just for myself. No debugging, no rush to open a laptop for coding. Just peace, chai, and a book.

So I thought—let’s write something from the heart today.  
And what better book to talk about than one filled with **stories**? Real, raw, human stories that feel like they’ve come straight from the corners of our own lives.

Today’s blog is a personal review of a book that touched me deeply:  
📖 **“Wise and Otherwise: A Salute to Life” by Sudha Murthy**

## 🧒 Why This Book Took Me Back to Childhood

Before I tell you about the book itself, let me take you back to a simpler time…

Growing up, we didn’t have the luxury of buying new books every month. But I still managed to read—because I *wanted* to.

I had a neighbor who used to read **Champak**, **Nandan**, **Chacha Chaudhary**—and I’d literally wait for him to finish so I could borrow them. Sometimes I didn’t even wait; I’d just run to his home and ask, “Tumne book padh liya kya?,mujhe chaiye tha, mai padh kar wapas kar dugi” 😄

And of course, my grandparents were the *original storytellers*—the kind who could turn even a glass of water into a life lesson.

Since then, stories have always felt like home to me.  
That’s why **this book felt so personal**.  
Because “Wise and Otherwise” is not just a book.  
It’s **51 small windows into real Indian lives**—and each story teaches you something without shouting it.

## 📝 What Is “Wise and Otherwise” About?

It’s a collection of 51 real-life stories Sudha Murthy experienced first-hand or came across during her time working with the Infosys Foundation.

These aren’t made-up or over-dramatized. They’re *simple yet powerful*, just like life itself.  
Stories of kindness, betrayal, gratitude, greed, love, and everyday wisdom that make you stop, smile, or even tear up a little.

The beauty?  
👉 You can read one story a day.  
👉 No heavy commitment.  
👉 And every story leaves you with something real to carry forward.

## 💫 A Few Stories That Stayed With Me

There are so many good ones, but here are a few that deeply touched me:

### 🌸 1. *“A Lesson in Life from a Beggar”*

Sudha Murthy meets a beggar who gives her one of the most powerful lessons in *dignity and gratitude*.  
It’s not always the rich who are generous.  
Sometimes the people who have the least are the ones who give the most.

> 💡 It reminded me that *how* you give matters more than *what* you give.

---

### 💔 2. *“Death Without Grief”*

This one hurt. It’s about a man who abandons his old father at a temple without a second thought.  
That helplessness, that betrayal… it’s something no one deserves.

> 💡 This story made me call my parents. Just to check in. Just to say “thank you.”

---

### 🙏 3. *“Salam Namaste”*

Sudha Murthy meets a taxi driver abroad who recognizes her—and what follows is a story of *honour, identity, and how kindness comes back full circle*, even in foreign lands.

> 💡 You never know how far your words or actions can travel.

---

### 🧓 4. *“Three Thousand Stitches”* (Okay, this one's from another book, but equally relevant!)

She writes about rehabilitating women from the Devadasi system—and how difficult, yet important, the journey was. The title refers to the embroidery work done by the women to reclaim their dignity.

> 💡 We often judge others without knowing their story. This book reminds us to listen before we label.

---

Here’s your **updated blog section** with the additional stories **(no full rewrite, only an addition to the previous blog)**. I've smoothly inserted the new stories you mentioned—**"Bright Young Men," "The Truth About Women," "A Life With Dignity," and "Where There’s a Will…"**—along with GIF suggestions for where you could add visuals.

---

### 🎓5. **Bright Young Men**

This story is about a group of well-educated, privileged young men who shocked Sudha Murthy—not by their degrees, but by their **lack of humanity**.

They refused to help a poor, old man in need during an emergency simply because *"it’s not our problem."*

> 💡 It’s a strong reminder: Education doesn’t always mean empathy.

---

### 👩‍💼 6.**The Truth About Women**

In this story, Sudha Murthy meets a woman with an MBA, working a high-paying job—but trapped in a toxic relationship where her emotional and financial independence is suppressed.

The story challenges the idea that **education alone is enough to empower women.**  
It must be accompanied by **self-belief** and **courage to walk away** from disrespect.

> 💡 Real strength isn’t in your degree—it’s in your decisions.

---

### 🧕7. **A Life With Dignity**

One of the most touching stories in the book, this one is about a poor widow who chooses **dignity over survival**.  
She refuses help that came with pity or conditions—and lives on her own terms, even in poverty.

> 💡 Sometimes, *how* you live is more important than *how much* you have.

---

### 📜8. **Where There’s a Will…**

This story reveals how, even in death, people sometimes **leave behind more complications than blessings**.  
An elderly man’s will causes a bitter fight among his children, exposing how **greed can destroy families**.

> 💡 Death is not the end of responsibility. What we leave behind can either heal or break.

## 👩‍💼 My Personal Take

I’m not a superfan of Sudha Murthy.  
But I deeply respect her.  
She doesn’t write to impress. She writes to *connect*.  
And this book made me feel like I was sitting across from her, hearing life stories over tea.

As someone who codes for a living, I often live in a logical, structured world.  
But reading these stories… it made me feel soft again. Human again. Connected again.
