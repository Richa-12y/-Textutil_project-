Today, I didn’t learn Japanese.

But I learned something deeper.

After wrapping up work, I took permission from my senior and logged out early. I told them, “I have a train.” And I did—sort of. A personal train to a different kind of experience.

I packed my bags, headed to the metro, and waited for a friend. I stay alone in Bangalore, far from home. And while I’ve grown to love this city, there are days it hits hard—especially around festivals.

August 9 is \*\*Rakshabandhan\*\*. Back home, I’d be tying rakhi to my brother, eating mom-made sweets, laughing with my cousins. But this year, I won’t be there. That stings.

It’s one of the quiet disadvantages of chasing your dreams far from home.

**But Then—A Small Miracle**

My roommate—one of the kindest people I’ve met—and her mom (I call her \*aunty\* now) invited me over to their house. Tomorrow is Varalakshmi Puja, a big celebration in South India. And they wanted me to be part of it.

I said yes. I didn’t even think twice.

Now I’m here, in their home. But honestly? It \*feels\* like my home.

Aunty made the most delicious dinner. She speaks in Kannada, trying her best to help me understand, and I try to reply in Kannada or Hindi or English—whatever works. And somehow, it always works. Because when there’s love, language isn’t a barrier. It’s just a detail.

We’re now preparing everything for the puja—decorating for \*\*Goddess Lakshmi\*\*, arranging flowers, deciding which sari to wear tomorrow. The house is filled with chatter, laughter, the smell of food, and this feeling I’ve missed: family.

**What I Learned Today (Without a Textbook)**

Yes, I didn’t touch a Japanese lesson. No grammar. No vocabulary. No audio drills.

But I learned how rituals bring people together.

I learned that home isn’t always a place—it’s the people who open their hearts to you.

I learned that even when you’re far from your roots, new roots can grow.

And most importantly, I learned how powerful it is to be accepted—not because you speak the same language, but because you feel like one of their own.

Tomorrow?

I don’t know if I’ll study Japanese. I’ll try to listen to some shadowing audio while getting ready, maybe sneak in some review. But even if I don’t—this is still part of my journey.

Because learning a language isn’t just about words. It’s about connection. Culture. Empathy.

And today, I lived all of that.

Thank you for being here. For following along. For staying connected—even when the road gets personal.

またね (mata ne)– See you soon.

And if you're celebrating Varalakshmi Puja or Rakshabandhan—wishing you love, light, and family.
