# üéØProps

**Props are read-only components. It is an object which stores the value of attributes of a tag and work similar to the HTML attributes. **

- It allows passing data from one component to other components.
- It is similar to function arguments and can be passed to the component the same way as arguments passed in a function.
- Props are immutable so we cannot modify the props from inside the component.

# üéØState

**The state is an updatable structure that is used to contain data or information about the component and can change over time. **

- The change in state can happen as a response to user action or system event.
- It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render.
- A state must be kept as simple as possible.
- It represents the component's local state or information. It can only be accessed or modified inside the component or by the component directly.


## üéØDifference between Props and State

| Props      | State |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Props is data what child components need from parent components | State is use manage data of same  components    |
| Props is directly proportional to it's parent components  | if state of  components get update it will render the components    |
|If props data change on parent components it will re-render the components and show the updated change in UI   | state is use for logical operation in components  |
|Props is used to show the data in UI of particular components | state is use for holds information about components|
|Props are immutable.|State is mutable.|
|Props are read-only.|State can be changed.|
|Stateless component can have Props.|Stateless components cannot have State.|
|Props make components reusable.|State cannot make components reusable.|
|Props can be accessed by the child component.|State cannot be accessed by child components.|


**üëâThis table will guide you about the changing in props and state.
**


| SN      | Condition | Props  |State     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |
|    1.   | Can get initial value from parent Component?       | Yes   |Yes|
|   2.	|Can be changed by parent Component?	|Yes	|No|
|3.	|Can set default values inside Component?	|Yes	|Yes|
|4.	|Can change inside Component?	|No|	Yes|
|5.	|Can set initial value for child Components?|	Yes|	Yes|
|6.	|Can change in child Components?	|Yes	|No|


> ‚úçNote: The component State and Props share some common similarities. They are given in the below table.

| SN | State and Props |
| --- | ----------- |
|1.	|Both are plain JS object.|
|2.	|Both can contain default values.|
|3.	|Both are read-only when they are using by this.|
