Hey friends🦸‍♀️,  
It’s been a while since I last posted—life happened! 😅 Between work pressure and some personal ups and downs, I honestly didn’t have the headspace to sit down and write anything meaningful. But this month, something shifted. I picked up a book that I *really* needed to read, and I feel like it’s a sign to return to writing.

**So here I am, back—with something simple, powerful, and honestly, a bit eye-opening.**

### 📖 The Book: *Dopamine Detox* by Thibaut Meurisse

This book came to me at the perfect time. Short, crisp, and super impactful—it’s one of those reads that doesn’t try to sound too intellectual or deep, but hits you hard with reality.

### 💡 So… What’s This Book Really About?

![a stack of books with one that says engage & grow on it](https://media.tenor.com/V4EekBj0Kq4AAAAM/readers-leaders.gif align="center")

In one line:

> **It’s about taking control back from the endless distractions that silently run our lives.**

Thibaut talks about **dopamine**—the "feel good" chemical in our brain. Now, we all know that dopamine gives us pleasure. But what we don’t realize is: we’ve become slaves to it.

* **Scrolling Instagram for hours?** Dopamine.
    
* **Binge-watching Netflix till 2 AM?** Dopamine.
    
* **Jumping from app to app with zero productivity?** Yup… dopamine again.
    

We’re constantly seeking instant pleasure. And the more we give in, the *less* control we have over our attention, time, and ultimately, our life.

### 🧠 What Is a Dopamine Detox?

A dopamine detox doesn’t mean removing all pleasure from life. It means **taking a break from instant gratification**—the kind that makes you feel good *now* but leaves you drained, unmotivated, and anxious later.

Thibaut explains this with super relatable examples:

* Imagine you have an assignment to do—but instead, you decide to “just check one reel.” Suddenly, 45 minutes are gone. Your brain chose pleasure over productivity.
    
* Or you’re trying to lose weight—but that one cookie turns into five, and now you feel guilty. Again, your dopamine won.

### 🔄 So, What Can You Do?

![a man with a beard and a white shirt says " what can you do "](https://media.tenor.com/vb3tp_bCBycAAAAm/what-can-you-do-tosin-cole.webp align="center")

Thibaut suggests starting *small*:

* Set time blocks where you **don’t touch your phone or social media**.
    
* Spend 10–15 mins a day in silence—just thinking or journaling.
    
* Choose one day a week where you avoid anything “stimulating” (like junk food, TV, social media).
    

These little steps help **reset your brain** and bring back focus, clarity, and peace.

### 🙋 Why YOU Should Read This Book

![a woman is smiling while reading a book called pearl](https://media.tenor.com/7PzAal2OHXwAAAAM/kevin-can-f-himself-allison-mcroberts.gif align="center")

Because **you’ll see yourself in it**. It’s not preachy. It’s practical.  
If you:

* Feel like you can’t focus anymore
    
* Start 10 things but finish none
    
* Wake up already feeling drained
    
* Keep checking your phone even when nothing’s happening...
    

This book will *speak to you*. It helps you reflect, not feel guilty—and gives you tools to do better, not be perfect.
