This morning felt like opening a calendar—except every page was written in Japanese.

In today’s class, Sensei smiled as she began, \*“Today, we’ll travel through the 20 days together.”\* No planes, no tickets—just words. Twelve of them, to be exact.

We started with \*\*January\*\* – \*ichigatsu (一月)\*, “the first month.” It felt like a fresh notebook, waiting to be filled. Then \*\*February\*\* – \*nigatsu (二月)\*, short and quick, just like the real thing.

As we moved through \*sangatsu (三月)\*, \*shigatsu (四月)\*, and \*gogatsu (五月)\*, I imagined cherry blossoms, summer beginnings, and golden sunshine. Each month sounded like a step in a slow, deliberate dance.

By the time we reached \*juunigatsu (十二月)\*—December—I could almost feel winter wrapping around me. The months weren’t just names anymore; they were tiny doorways to seasons, festivals, and memories I haven’t yet lived in Japan but can already picture.

Learning them was simple:

\* Numbers 1 to 12 in Japanese

\* Add \*\*gatsu (月)\*\*, meaning “month”

That’s it. \*Ichigatsu. Nigatsu. Sangatsu…\* A rhythm, like a song you hum without realizing.

But as Sensei reminded us, \*“Language is not just vocabulary—it’s time itself. Every word you learn is a moment you can now live in another culture.”\*

Today, I didn’t just memorize months. I felt a year pass in Japanese.

\*\*またね (Mata ne)\*\* – until the next class.
