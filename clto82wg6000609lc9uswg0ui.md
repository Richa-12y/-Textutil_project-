**Hello everyone <sup>üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª</sup>, it's Richa here. Today, I want to share my journey with you, especially on this Women's Day.** I've seen the #IWD2024 tag floating around, and it inspired me to reflect on <mark> my own experiences and perhaps offer a beacon of hope to those who might be facing similar challenges</mark>

**Growing up, I wasn't exactly the most popular person, but that never deterred me from dreaming big.** When I decided to pursue a career in tech, I encountered doubts and discouragement from some of my peers, who believed it wasn't something a girl should aspire to. But I refused to let their narrow-mindedness dictate my path.

In my blog, I've documented my journey from a dreamer to a developer. Despite the naysayers, I persisted, always reminding myself that <mark> my gender doesn't define my capabilities.</mark> I embraced the role of a perpetual student, always eager to learn and unafraid to seek help when needed, regardless of the source.

Today, **I proudly proclaim myself as a developer. But my journey doesn't end there. I've also taken on the role of a mentor, guiding and supporting aspiring developers who, like me, dare to defy stereotypes and pursue their passion for technology.**

*This blog isn't just about my personal achievements; it's about advocating for change in the tech industry. It's about breaking down barriers and creating an inclusive environment where everyone, regardless of gender, race, or background, can thrive and contribute.*

So, to all the dreamers out there, especially the women, don't let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do. **<mark>Believe in yourself, embrace change, and together, let's participate in tech and bring about a revolution.</mark>**

Certainly! Here are 10 key lessons I've learned on my journey to becoming a developer:

1. **Continuous Learning**: The tech landscape is constantly evolving, and to stay relevant, you must embrace a mindset of continuous learning. Be open to new technologies, frameworks, and methodologies.
    
2. **Problem-Solving Skills**: As a developer, you'll encounter numerous challenges and bugs to squash. Developing strong problem-solving skills is essential for navigating through these obstacles efficiently.
    
3. **Attention to Detail**: In coding, even the smallest typo can lead to big errors. Cultivating a keen eye for detail is crucial for writing clean, efficient code and debugging effectively.
    
4. **Collaboration and Communication**: Tech projects rarely involve working in isolation. Learning to collaborate effectively with team members and communicate clearly about your ideas and progress is essential for success.
    
5. **Adaptability**: Tech is an ever-changing field, and what works today may be outdated tomorrow. Being adaptable and willing to pivot when necessary is key to thriving in this industry.
    
6. **Resilience**: Failure and setbacks are inevitable in coding. Developing resilience and the ability to bounce back from challenges is essential for maintaining motivation and momentum.
    
7. **Documentation**: Writing clear and comprehensive documentation is just as important as writing code itself. It helps you and others understand your work, facilitates collaboration, and ensures maintainability.
    
8. **Testing and Debugging**: Testing your code thoroughly and debugging effectively are critical skills for ensuring that your software works as intended and delivering a high-quality product to your users.
    
9. **Time Management**: Tech projects often come with tight deadlines and competing priorities. Learning to manage your time effectively and prioritize tasks is essential for meeting deadlines and delivering results.
    
10. **Networking**: Building a strong professional network can open doors to new opportunities, whether it's finding a job, collaborating on projects, or seeking mentorship. Invest in building relationships within the tech community.
    

These are just a few of the many lessons I've learned on my journey as a developer. Each day brings new challenges and opportunities for growth, and I'm excited to continue learning and evolving in this dynamic field.
