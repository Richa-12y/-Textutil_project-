Konnichiwa minna-san.

Today’s blog won’t be about Hiragana or Katakana. No phrases. No vocabulary.

Just… life. 🫶

Yesterday, I managed to listen to some Japanese audio. But today — nothing.

**Why? Because I'm not well. I’ve been dealing with severe stomach pain and fever, so I took a leave from work and just rested. No energy to cook, no energy to study.**

All I could manage was a little rice, bitter gourd, and lots of tea to soothe the pain. 🍚🍵

Mostly, I stayed in bed. Tired, aching, half-asleep — and yes, disappointed that I didn’t study.

But here’s what today taught me

💬 It's Okay to Pause

I felt bad. I didn’t revise a single word in Japanese.

But then I realized something:

I shouldn’t be so hard on myself.

We’re all human. We get tired. We fall sick. We need rest.

Taking care of your body is also a way to honor your goals. Because if you don’t have your health, how will you chase your dreams?

**🌀 What Naruto Taught Me Today**

While resting, I started watching \*\*Naruto\*\* — one of my all-time favorite anime.

And from that, I was reminded of a few powerful life lessons:

\&gt; 🥷 “Never give up on a good thing, even if it’s hard.”

\&gt; 🥷 “Don’t choose the wrong path just because it’s easier.”

\&gt; 🥷 “Being yourself matters more than being perfect.”

Even though I didn’t learn Japanese today, I learned something deeper.

Sometimes, lessons don’t come from books or flashcards.

They come from pain, tea, and a quiet anime episode that hits you just right.

🧡 **Final Thoughts**

So, no language progress today.

But I’m proud that I listened to my body and gave it what it needed — rest.

Tomorrow, I’ll continue my journey.

But for now…

It’s okay.

Oyasuminasai, minna-san. 🌙

またね (Matane) – see you tomorrow.

**If you’ve ever felt guilty for taking a break — this blog is for you.**

Healing is also progress. 🙏
