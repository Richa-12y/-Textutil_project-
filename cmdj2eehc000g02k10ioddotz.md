**Konnichiwa, minna-san!** 👋✨  
It’s Day 5 of my Japanese learning journey, and today was a bit slow — I’m fasting and feeling a little tired. But still, I didn’t want to skip my routine or lose my consistency. 🌙🙏

Instead of learning something new, I focused on **revising Hiragana** again and **memorizing 20+ of the most commonly used Japanese sentences** that will help me in daily conversations.

### ✨ Why These Sentences?

Because they are **practical**, **repetitive**, and **used daily in real-world situations**. From self-introductions to asking directions, these sentences form the building blocks of casual and polite conversation. I plan to make flashcards and use them in mock conversations.

Tomorrow I will attend a **Japanese class**, and I’m excited to start learning **Katakana** from there. But for now, I’m making sure my Hiragana and basics are solid. 📚✨

### 🌧️ Final Thoughts

Even on days when you’re tired or fasting, doing something small to stay on track is still progress. It’s not about how much you study — it’s about showing up. 💪

Let’s keep this energy going together. Stay tuned for tomorrow’s update and feel free to drop comments, corrections, or connect if you’re learning too!

ありがとう! またね!
