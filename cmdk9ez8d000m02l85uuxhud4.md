**Konnichiwa, minna-san!** 🙌 Today has been such a fulfilling day. Since it wasn’t a working day, I had the whole day to dedicate to my Japanese learning—and wow, what a day it was! 🧠🎌

I spent **3 solid hours** diving deep into new concepts and finally learning to read full Japanese greetings without relying heavily on Romaji. This is a big achievement for me, and I’m so thrilled to share it with you all. 💪🌟

### 🔄 Revision Done:

* **Dakuten (だくてん / "ten-ten")** and **Handakuten (はんだくてん / "maru")**
    
* **Combo sounds with small や・ゆ・よ (ya/yu/yo)**
    
* **Long vowels and small つ (っ)**

### 🌀 What Are Dakuten & Handakuten?

These are small marks added to kana that change their pronunciation:

#### **Dakuten** (ﾞ - looks like a double quote mark):

* Changes: か → が, さ → ざ, た → だ, は → ば, etc.
    
* Example: か (ka) → が (ga), た (ta) → だ (da)
    

#### **Handakuten** (ﾟ - small circle):

* Applies only to the H-series kana
    
* Changes: は (ha) → ぱ (pa), ひ (hi) → ぴ (pi), etc.

### 🧠 Tip to Memorize:

* Focus on the **I-syllables** like: き (ki), し (shi), ち (chi), に (ni), ひ (hi), み (mi), り (ri)
    
* Combine with small **や・ゆ・よ**:
    
    * きゃ, きゅ, きょ → kya, kyu, kyo
        
    * しゃ, しゅ, しょ → sha, shu, sho
        
    * ちゃ, ちゅ, ちょ → cha, chu, cho
        
    * ぎゃ, ぎゅ, ぎょ → gya, gyu, gyo
        
    * にゃ, にゅ, にょ → nya, nyu, nyo
        
    * ひゃ, ひゅ, ひょ → hya, hyu, hyo
        
    * ぴゃ, ぴゅ, ぴょ → pya, pyu, pyo
        

This **pattern recognition trick** helped me memorize combos quickly!

### 📚 Practice Material Used:

* I tried reading the *Minna no Nihongo* greeting section **without Romaji**, and I could read almost everything fluently. That felt amazing! 💖
