**Minna-san, Konnichiwa!** 🙏✨

Today marks **Day 15** of my Japanese learning journey, and I have something special to share—not just the vocabulary or grammar, but a life lesson I experienced through the process of language learning. 🧠💬

---

### 🛏️ A Real Day in My Life

I started my day with regular home activities—groceries, meal prep, house and washroom cleaning, and taking care of myself. After dinner, I sat with my notebook to revise Japanese. I didn’t get a huge chunk of time, but what mattered was **consistency and focus**. Even if it’s 15 minutes, I give it my full attention. 💯

### 📖 What I Practiced Today:

✅ **Hiragana & Katakana Revision** (again!) because we have a test coming up next week.

✅ Practiced **vocabulary and grammar from my notes**:

### 🎧 Shadowing: A Game-Changer for Speaking

Today, I focused on **shadowing**, a technique my sensei recommended. I listened to native Japanese speakers and tried repeating after them.

🔁 Sometimes I got the pronunciation wrong.  
🗣️ Sometimes I made typos while writing in Japanese.

But you know what? That’s **completely okay**.[Here's YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/2yB-D2oGU40?si=z5F_ZoDJRU1-BLjB)

Because...

### 🧠 My Learning Philosophy

Until you **try**, you won’t learn.  
Until you **make mistakes**, you won’t grow.

I reminded myself of how I learned English—by saying the wrong things, being corrected, and trying again. People corrected me, and I thanked them. That’s how I improved. 🙏

Now, I’m doing the same with Japanese.

I treat myself like a **child learning a new language**.  
Because when you think like an adult, you’re afraid of making mistakes. But when you let yourself be a curious learner, the journey becomes beautiful. 🌈

So don’t be shy. Let people laugh. Just keep going.

---

### 💫 Final Thought:

**"Made made desu."**  
*I still have a long way to go.*

But I’m enjoying every bit of it.  
Be a learner. Be a lifetime student. You’ll find more satisfaction in the journey than the destination.

**ありがとう！またね！**  
*Thank you! See you again!*

~ *Richa* (りちゃ)
