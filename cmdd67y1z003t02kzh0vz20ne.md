Hey everyone!  
Today is one of those chilled-out rainy days in Bangalore. The weather is amazing, but unfortunately, I’m down with some stomach pain, so I decided to take a break from work.

At first, I thought I’d just rest and not push myself too much. But then a thought hit me — **consistency matters.** If not now, when?

So, I opened my laptop, grabbed a warm cup of tea, and started something I’ve been wanting to do for a long time — **seriously learn Japanese.** 🇯🇵✨

### 🌸 Why Japanese?

I’ve been fascinated by Japanese culture for years. Their discipline, the way they respect people, their minimalistic and peaceful lifestyle — everything inspires me.  
From anime to Ikigai, from sushi to tea ceremonies — there’s something so graceful about how Japan lives. I want to learn not just the language, but also the **culture, the values, and the mindset** behind it.

### 📚 Where I Started

I’ve casually practiced Japanese before using Duolingo — just 5 minutes here and there. But now I’ve decided to go deeper. No more random learning.  
**Today is Day 1. And I’m starting with Hiragana.**

I downloaded a practice sheet (like the one from ちびむすドリル) and began tracing the first rows:

* あ (a), い (i), う (u), え (e), お (o)
    
* か, き, く, け, こ
    
* さ, し, す...
    
* ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1753105990004/4234c09d-a0c2-4f0a-a412-3efc3430699d.png align="center")
    

And I must say — **Hiragana is beautiful.** It’s not just writing; it feels like meditation.

### 🧘‍♀️ Why I’m Taking It Seriously Now

Something shifted in me today. Maybe it’s the rain. Maybe it’s the silence.  
But I told myself — if I truly want to respect this culture, I need to understand it from within.

So from today onwards, I’ll post regular updates on my blog — what I learn, how I feel, and what helped me. Whether you’re a beginner or fluent, let’s connect and **build a Japanese learning community together.**

### 💬 Want to Learn with Me?

If you’re also learning Japanese (or planning to), feel free to connect!  
Let’s exchange words, practice pronunciation, and support each other.

I’ll be posting daily progress — even if it’s just a few characters. And if you’re a native speaker or a Japanese learner, I’d love to chat and learn from you too.
