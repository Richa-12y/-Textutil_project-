**It‚Äôs a rainyüòá Saturday evening in Bangalore.** The sky is heavy, not just with clouds but with the weight of thoughts circling in my head. I‚Äôve finished my development work for the week, and for once, I have a moment to breathe. No noise, no office calls, just the sound of drizzle tapping on the windowpane. And in this stillness, one loud thought echoes in my mind: **What is really changing for women in our society?**

I opened my laptop, lit a small diya beside me, and decided ‚Äî *this is the blog I must write today*. Not just because I have time, but because I have fire inside me. The kind of fire that burns quietly until it spills into words.

### **The Illusion of Equality**

**We often hear it now: *"Women have equal rights. Times have changed."***

**But have they really?**

<mark>I scroll through Instagram, and I see content creators bashing women ‚Äî because of a few cases where women might have done wrong. Suddenly, all women are labeled as manipulative, selfish, or gold-diggers. I am not justifying wrongdoing ‚Äî right is right and wrong is wrong.</mark> But when women are targeted and generalized, it breaks something inside me.

Because nobody shows you the other side ‚Äî the girl who is denied education just because she is a girl, the woman who is still burned for dowry, or the one who gives up on life because she was told her dreams were *too big for a girl*. We say we are progressing, but the progress is only visible on the surface ‚Äî a corporate woman in a suit doesn‚Äôt mean all women are free.

### **Still in a Cage**

![a woman is holding a piece of paper that is on fire and the words little women movie are on the bottom right](https://media.tenor.com/GLmB_mSFG-IAAAAM/burn-letter.gif align="left")

In reality, many women are still expected to live like birds in a cage. You can be beautiful, educated, even working ‚Äî but only inside the boundary set by society. You must not speak too loud, not dream too big, not wear what makes *you* comfortable, and definitely not say no.

**The irony is ‚Äî we are given wings but forbidden to fly.**

![a group of people are dancing in front of a camera with the words little women movie written on the bottom](https://media.tenor.com/80UNCssl1AYAAAAM/jumping-dancing.gif align="left")

**<mark>If we speak up, we are aggressive.<br>If we stay silent, we are weak.<br>If we are successful, we are arrogant.<br>If we fail, we are incapable.</mark>**

***Where exactly do we belong then?***

### **Double Standards Run Deep**

Let‚Äôs talk about morality ‚Äî why is a woman‚Äôs character always on trial? If a man cheats, it's "boys will be boys." If a woman even talks about freedom, she‚Äôs accused of being too modern or too shameless.

Let me remind you, when men were allowed four marriages in history, no one questioned their values. But today, if a woman even dares to live on her own terms, society begins to dissect her behavior.

Are we truly living in an equal world if one gender has a thousand ways to justify their actions, while the other has to justify their *existence*?

### **Why I Am Writing This**

I didn‚Äôt always feel this deeply about these things. When I was in [B.Tech](http://B.Tech), my communication was weak, and I never thought I could express myself like this. But life changed when I started reading ‚Äî thanks to my uncle and roommates who introduced me to the world of self-help books.

![a woman is clapping her hands in the dark .](https://media.tenor.com/pkjL4S7xxaEAAAAM/saoirse-ronan-saoirse-ronan-little-women.gif align="left")

One book became two, and now I‚Äôve read more than 50. With every book, I healed a little. I understood the power of journaling, affirmations, and gratitude. My mom used to say, *‚ÄúAchha bolo, achha hota hai.‚Äù* That stayed with me.

So here I am ‚Äî combining that belief with what I see around me. The pain. The inequality. The silence. And this blog is my voice ‚Äî for every girl who‚Äôs still asked to shut hers.

### **What Needs to Change**

* **Stop setting different standards for women.**
    
* **Educate every girl, not just the ones in cities.**
    
* **Allow women to make their own choices without judgment.**
    
* **Teach boys to respect, not control.**
    
* **Stop using religion and culture as tools to imprison women‚Äôs freedom.**

### **Not All Men, But Enough**

Let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî not all men are the same. We know that. Some of the best people in my life are men who uplift and support. But enough men are silent spectators, enough men forward misogynistic jokes, and enough men expect women to remain small to protect their own ego.

**<mark>We are not here to blame.<br>We are here to be seen.<br>Heard.<br>Understood.</mark>**

## **Conclusion: Let Her Fly**

I believe in God, and every Friday, I fast for my healing, for my strength, for the energy to live a life of meaning. **<mark>I believe that </mark> *<mark>God gave women the same brain, same soul, and same heart as He gave to men</mark>*<mark>. Then who are you to treat us less?</mark>**

This blog is a reminder ‚Äî to every woman reading this ‚Äî you are not wrong for wanting more. You are not wrong for raising your voice. And to every man reading this ‚Äî if you truly believe in equality, then let your actions speak, not your conditions.
