Hi friends,

Today has been a fantastic day. I just wrapped up my development work — everything went smoothly (which isn’t always the case!), and after logging out, I finally sat down to write my 7th book review blog.

It’s Friday — a sacred day for me. I fast every Friday not just as a religious ritual, but as a gentle way to reset my body and soul. No cooking today, a bit of cleaning left — but otherwise, this evening is mine. A moment of peace, reflection, and writing.

And what better book to talk about today than **“The Power of Now” by Eckhart Tolle** — a life-altering read that taught me the *magic of this exact moment*.

### 🌼 How I Came Across This Book

It was a YouTube video, actually. I heard Oprah mention it in one of her interviews. “This book changed my life,” she said. I paused the video. If someone like Oprah — who’s seen so much in life — says that, I had to know more.

I searched it. Ordered it. And once it arrived, I didn’t just read it — I *experienced* it.

### 📘 What *The Power of Now* Is All About

This book is a deep but gentle guide into spiritual awakening. Eckhart Tolle writes in a way that’s both simple and profound. He’s not trying to impress with big words — he’s guiding us back to something we’ve all forgotten:

> **The present moment is all we ever truly have.**

Most of us live in our heads — regrets about the past, anxieties about the future. We replay memories, plan constantly, worry endlessly.

Tolle says: Stop. Just *be*. Right now.

---

### 🧠 Key Takeaways From the Book

#### 1\. **You Are Not Your Thoughts**

This blew my mind. We think we are our thoughts. But Tolle shows how our thoughts are just passing clouds. You, the real you, are the sky.

This detachment gave me peace like never before. No longer controlled by every anxious thought, I started observing them — without judgment.

#### 2\. **Pain-Body and Emotional Triggers**

Tolle introduces the idea of the *pain-body* — the emotional baggage we all carry. When we don’t heal, we react, often unconsciously. Becoming aware of your pain-body is the first step to freeing yourself from it.

#### 3\. **Silence is Powerful**

Tolle writes beautifully about the value of silence. Not just the absence of noise, but *internal silence*. In stillness, truth arises.

I started practicing quiet pauses between tasks, deep breaths before speaking, just being still. It changed how I see time.

#### 4\. **Presence in Daily Life**

You don’t need to escape to a forest to be spiritual. You can be deeply present while washing dishes, writing code, or sipping tea.

This lesson made my routine divine.

### ✅ Why You Should Read This Book

* You feel mentally overwhelmed and overstimulated.
    
* You struggle to slow down or enjoy small things.
    
* You're constantly thinking — past, future, what ifs.
    
* You want a deeper connection to your soul, your purpose, your *being*.
    

If any of these feel true, this book is your whisper back home.

---

### ❌ But It's Not for Everyone…

Let’s be honest. This book isn’t your typical “5 steps to success” type.

* It doesn’t give quick fixes.
    
* It’s more *experiential* than logical.
    
* At times, it may feel repetitive or abstract if you're new to spiritual language.
    

But if you stay with it, something clicks. And when it does, you’ll never look at life the same way again.

---

### ❤️ My Favourite Line:

> *“Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. Make the Now the primary focus of your life.”*

I stuck this line on my wall. It's a daily reminder that *this* moment — not tomorrow’s plans or yesterday’s mistakes — is where life truly lives.

### 💬 I’d Love to Hear From You

If you've read this book, tell me:

* What part stayed with you?
    
* Was it difficult to read at first?
    
* Did it help you slow down and breathe?
    

And if you haven't read it yet — would you? What holds you back? I’d love to hear your perspective.

Reading this book while fasting, feeling light and grounded, reminded me why I started this blog series in the first place. Books have saved me — again and again — and I believe they can help you too.
