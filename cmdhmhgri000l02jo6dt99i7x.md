**Konnichiwa, minna-san!** 👋✨  
It’s Day 4 of my Japanese learning journey, and today I decided to **pause and revise** rather than rush ahead. I’ve realized something important: mastering the basics is more powerful than skimming through the next level.

### 🔁 Hiragana Revision – Why It’s Important

Today I didn’t start Katakana. Instead, I went back to revise Hiragana — and let me tell you, it *looks* easy at first… but some characters can get seriously confusing! 😅

Here are some that I personally found tricky:

| Similar Sounding/Looking Hiragana | Romanji | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ぬ vs め vs ね vs れ | nu / me / ne / re | Watch the loops! |
| わ vs は vs ほ | wa / ha / ho | Subtle strokes make a difference |
| け vs は | ke / ha | Very close! |
| ま vs ほ | ma / ho | Slight tilt can change everything |

So today, I practiced writing these out carefully. I realized that **recognizing the differences in shape and stroke order** helps in memorizing them better.

That’s why I’m sticking with Hiragana until it’s fully set in my memory. Only then will I move to Katakana.

### 🔢 Learning Numbers in Japanese (1 to 10)

Along with revision, I also started learning **Japanese numbers** today — from 1 to 10.

| Number | Hiragana | Romanji |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | いち | ichi |
| 2 | に | ni |
| 3 | さん | san |
| 4 | よん / し | yon / shi |
| 5 | ご | go |
| 6 | ろく | roku |
| 7 | なな / しち | nana / shichi |
| 8 | はち | hachi |
| 9 | きゅう / く | kyuu / ku |
| 10 | じゅう | juu |

Learning numbers felt fun and practical. I’m trying to use them while counting random things around the house — like books on the shelf or spoons in the drawer. 😄 It really helps with memory!

### 🌧️ Evening Thoughts

After work, I felt so tired — but I still pushed myself to sit and study, even if only for a short time. Because this is for *me*. And that’s worth every bit of effort. 💪💖

This struggle is necessary, this consistency is powerful, and this journey is beautiful. I hope tomorrow I’ll get more time and can push myself a bit further.

Stay connected with me as I continue to share my honest updates and progress.

ありがとう! またね!
