# üìöReact useReducer Hook ultimate guide‚ú®

## **üéØ Introduction**

**Hello, React Developers!! üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª Today we are going to learn about <mark>useReducer. </mark>** `useReducer` is one of the additional Hooks that shipped with React v16.8. An alternative to the `useState` Hook, The `useReducer` Hook is similar to the `useState` Hook. It allows for custom state logic. `useReducer` <mark>helps you manage complex state logic in React applications.</mark>

`useReducer` can be a good alternative to <mark>Redux</mark> In certain cases, it is an outright better option.

**<mark>üïπState management</mark>**

We often hear about the <mark>state, state changes, and state management</mark>. *What exactly is the state?* We can take this literally by saying that it‚Äôs the current state of your program, but that might not be too easy to understand. In programming, the state is simply the combination of all the data we currently have in our application, the data that is utilized and returned by your ongoing program.

<mark>What exactly is state management?</mark> *According to Wikipedia*, ‚Äù**State management**" refers to the management of the state of one or more user interface controls such as <mark>text fields, OK buttons, radio buttons</mark>, etc.‚Äù

## **üé°useReduce vs useState**

[useSate](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#basic-hooks) is a <mark>basic Hook for managing simple state transformation</mark>, and [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#additional-hooks)¬†<mark>is an additional Hook for managing more complex state logic.</mark> However, *it‚Äôs worth noting that* `useState` *uses* `useReducer` *internally, implying that you could use* `useReducer` *for everything you can do with* `useState`*.*

**There are some major differences between these two Hooks**. With `useReducer`<mark>, you can avoid passing down callbacks through different levels of your component</mark>. Instead, `useReducer` *allows you to pass a provided* `dispatch` *function, which in turn will improve performance for components that trigger deep updates.*

However, <mark>this does not imply that the </mark> `useState` <mark>updater function is newly called on each render.</mark> **When you have a complex logic to update state,** you simply won‚Äôt use the setter directly to update state. Instead, you‚Äôll write a complex function, <mark>which in turn would call the setter with updated state.</mark>

Therefore, it‚Äôs recommended to use `useReducer`<mark>, which returns a </mark> `dispatch` <mark>method that doesn‚Äôt change between re-renders, and you can have the manipulation logic in the reducers.</mark>

**It‚Äôs also worth noting that with** `useState`, the state updater function is invoked to update state, but with `useReducer`<mark>, the </mark> `dispatch` <mark>function is invoked instead, and an action with at least a type is passed to it.</mark>

## **üìçSetting Development Area**

<mark>We need to run this command:-</mark>

`npx create-react-app counter`

`cd counter`

`npm start`

**After installation, we should have this.**

**üìç useReducer**

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
```

<mark>UseReducer</mark> **returns an array with the first element being the state and the second element being a dispatch function** that will invoke the **useReducer**.

**To build the counter application,** <mark>we need four files:</mark> the main `App.js` to *render our components;* `Counter.js` for our counter application; `Reducer.js` **where we will manage the application state using our useReducer logic**; and our `App.css`

## **üîî**Counter Application

<mark>This is the way we could start this.</mark>

```javascript
const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, 0);
```

Instead of a setter in `useState`, we used `dispatch`. ‚Äú<mark>Dispatch</mark>‚Äù here has its literal meaning, more like you will want to send something: you could say ‚Äúsend an action‚Äù. We will process it with a reducer function. **As we can see up there, we have the state 0. Let‚Äôs start building the counter application.**

`App.js`

```javascript
import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";
import Counter from "./Counter";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Building a simple counter app with the <b>useReducer Hook</b>
        </p>
        <Counter />
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

`//Counter.js`

```javascript
/** This is Counter.js 
**/
import React, { useReducer } from "react";
import reducer from "./Reducer";

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, 0);

  return (
    <div className="container">
      <div className="card">
        <h1>Counter Application</h1>
        <h3>{count}</h3>
        <div>
          <button className="btn1" onClick={() => dispatch("increment")}>
            increment
          </button>

          <button className="btn2" onClick={() => dispatch("decrement")}>
            decrement
          </button>

          <button className="btn3" onClick={() => dispatch("reset")}>
            Reset
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
```

`App.css`

```css
/* Counter Application css start here */
.App {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: black;
}

.App-logo {
  height: 20vmin;
  pointer-events: none;
}

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .App-logo {
    animation: App-logo-spin infinite 20s linear;
  }
}

.App-header {
  background-color:black;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  font-size: calc(10px + 2vmin);
  color: white;
}



@keyframes App-logo-spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

/* Counter Application css start here */

.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  cursor: pointer;
}

h3 {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.btn1 {
  background-color: blue;
  padding: 15px;
  margin: 20px;
  color: beige;
  border-radius: 15px;
  border: 1px solid white;
  width: 150px;
  opacity: 0.5;
  font-weight: 700;
}
.btn1:hover{
    opacity: 1;
}

.btn2 {
  padding: 15px;
  background-color: red;
  margin: 20px;
  color: beige;
  border-radius: 15px;
  border: 1px solid white;
    width: 150px;
    opacity: 0.5;
      font-weight: 700;
}
.btn2:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}

.btn3 {
  padding: 15px;
  background-color: green;
  margin: 20px;
  color: beige;
  border-radius: 15px;
  border: 1px solid white;
    width: 150px;
    opacity: 0.5;
      font-weight: 700;
}

.btn3:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

**We also have:-**`Reducer.js`

```javascript
//Reducer.js

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  if (action === "increment") {
    return state + 1;
  } else if (action === "decrement") {
    return state - 1;
  } else if (action === "reset") {
    return 0;
  } else {
    throw new Error();
  }
};

export default reducer;
```

<mark>The code above shows</mark> a `counter application` whose state is managed by the <mark>useReducer hook</mark>. *A counter doesn‚Äôt teach much about complex state management, but then I will explain the logic used above.* The reducer takes in our state and a dispatched action. In `Reducer.js`, the reducer function takes in our state, and the action is dispatched, then we use our conditional statement. **We had our** `if-else` **and passed in our** `action.type`**. We passed** `increment`**,** `decrement`**, and** `reset` **to the** `onclick` **function in JSX.**

**We can now test our application if this works out well. Initially we have:-**

**After some increments, we get:-**

**After some decrement, we get:-**

**After Reset It will come to the initial status:-**

**This is where we begin to see** `useReducer` **shine its light on us.** We may not have observed that we have entirely detached the update logic of our state from our component. We are now mapping actions to state transitions, and we can now separate how the state updates from the actions that occurred.
