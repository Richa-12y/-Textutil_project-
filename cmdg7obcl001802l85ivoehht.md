\*\*Konnichiwa, minna-san!\*\* 👋✨

Today marks \*\*Day 3\*\* of my Japanese language learning journey, and I'm happy to share — \*\*I’ve officially completed the Hiragana series!\*\* 🎉✨

Sure, it’s not the end — I know I’ll need to revise daily or I’ll forget everything, but I’m proud of myself for staying consistent even with just 30 minutes of study time. Sometimes progress is simply about showing up. 🙌

\### 🧠 What I Learned Today:

I practiced Hiragana revision and also focused on \*\*self-introduction in Japanese\*\* — a big step toward holding real conversations someday!

\#### 🗣️ Self Introduction Practice:

\&gt; わたし は Richa です。 (Watashi wa Richa desu.) – I am Richa.

\&gt; インド から きました。 (Indo kara kimashita.) – I am from India.

\&gt; にじゅうごさい です。 (Nijuu go sai desu.) – I am 25 years old.

\&gt; ありがとう ございます！(Arigatou gozaimasu!) – Thank you!

\&gt; おやすみなさい！(Oyasuminasai!) – Good night!

Learning to introduce myself made me feel more connected — like I’ve taken one real step toward speaking like a native. 💬

\### 🎴 Hiragana Chart – Completed!

Here’s what I’ve covered over the last 3 days:

| A | KA | SA | TA | NA | HA | MA | YA | RA | WA | N |

| ----- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ----- |

| あ (a) | か (ka) | さ (sa) | た (ta) | な (na) | は (ha) | ま (ma) | や (ya) | ら (ra) | わ (wa) | ん (n) |

| い (i) | き (ki) | し (shi) | ち (chi) | に (ni) | ひ (hi) | み (mi) | | り (ri) | | |

| う (u) | く (ku) | す (su) | つ (tsu) | ぬ (nu) | ふ (fu) | む (mu) | ゆ (yu) | る (ru) | | |

| え (e) | け (ke) | せ (se) | て (te) | ね (ne) | へ (he) | め (me) | | れ (re) | | |

| お (o) | こ (ko) | そ (so) | と (to) | の (no) | ほ (ho) | も (mo) | よ (yo) | ろ (ro) | を (wo) | |

I’ll revise this regularly to strengthen my memory and reading fluency.

\### 🌧️ Real Talk: The Struggle is Real… but Worth It!

Let me be honest — today Bangalore is cold, it’s raining, and the weather just whispers: \*“Sleep, not study.”\* 😴☔

After a full day of office work, cooking, and cleaning, sitting down to study isn’t easy. But even in this chilled night, I kept the promise I made to myself. And that feels beautiful. 🌙

Learning a new language isn’t just about alphabets and grammar. It’s about \*\*commitment\*\*, \*\*curiosity\*\*, and \*\*discipline\*\* — and the joy of discovering something new every day.
