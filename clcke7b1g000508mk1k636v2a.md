### üë®‚Äçüíª**My experience in 2022: üöÄ**

Heading back toward 2022, this year provided me with a lot of fun and good opportunities with lots of rejections, You can be Asked Like what kind of rejections, so let me tell you now I'm working as a developer but whenever I'm going to give an interview in any company there see in my resume I worked as a technical support executive also after that they don't want me. most of the time my resume getting not selected so I get frustrated. whenever I thought let's give up then I remember this quotes **<mark>"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall". </mark> *One question comes to my mind if I am not able to complete this journey then why did I start?***

**What do I learn?ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**

If you want to grow in software development, you have to have the attitude of never stopping learning. Do not hesitate if you don't know something related to your project ask your senior, or juniors who know that thing which you do not know. I know I have to put a lot of effort into DSA my brother is very good at DSA so I asked him to help me teach me DSA. He guides me on how to Learn DSA. so you have to search in your group if is there any person who helps you to grow then stick with them.

## **Learnings from 2022 üí™**

![Schitts Creek Comedy GIF by CBC](https://media3.giphy.com/media/1kenyYNFG9wTUyHMjk/200w.gif?cid=ecf05e474m70lxpzzyhjc7sfcpanjdfbw57yvtbe9lq7ko4a&rid=200w.gif&ct=g align="center")

I learn gratitude in 2022 I start writing Gratitude journaling is a technique that involves keeping a diary of things you‚Äôre grateful for every day. This is one of the most popular ways to practice gratitude.

Some good starting points are to recount a favorite moment from the day, describe a special person in your life, or list five things you‚Äôre grateful for that day.

It doesn‚Äôt even have to be a physical journal. It can be as simple as a note in your phone. This makes it easier to quickly record something you feel grateful for in the moment.

### **Gratitude mapping**

Gratitude mapping is perfect for visual learners. It involves creating a visual mood board of everything you‚Äôre grateful for. You then place this board somewhere in your home to remind yourself to be grateful every day.

**<mark>"The real gift of gratitude is that the more grateful you are,the more present you become"</mark>**

## **Read Book You learn a lot!!üíñ**

![Korean Drama Thank You GIF by The Swoon](https://media3.giphy.com/media/yWJR17YWGTmTdNpLPE/200w.gif?cid=ecf05e479h8b06s5c44ba5ayeq2x7yxa0oci5goeedyfa34d&rid=200w.gif&ct=g align="center")

Some people would say that all you need to do is work hard to achieve what you want in life. Some people think it's about who you know or what you have. ¬†Yet others feel there are those born with access and that they are given all the breaks in life. ¬†The truth is, statistics demonstrate that those who create goals and have a regular and consistent goal-setting process are much more likely to achieve their life‚Äôs dreams.

Regardless of how hard you work, if you are aiming for the wrong dream, then all that effort will only get you to the wrong destination faster, and that would be extremely disappointing.

Despite connections, you still have to continuously demonstrate to everyone that you were worthy of receiving the opportunity in the first place. ¬†Eventually, proving your worth to others becomes exhausting.

However, there is a formula for turning your dreams into reality, and it isn't dependent on who you know or proving yourself. ¬†The formula is:

**<mark>goals + commitment = dreams come true</mark>**

By having clear goals, you become aware of precisely what you want to achieve and how to go about doing it. You can more accurately assess and measure your ability to accomplish the goals and most importantly, you have a plan that can guide you along the way and keep you on track.

Add commitment and determination to your goals and you will find that you are willing to take continuous and consistent action toward making your dreams a reality, despite any obstacles in your path, including difficult times.
