## How It All Started: The Accidental Discovery 🤯

I knew absolutely **nothing** about web development. Like, literally **zero**. Writing code? Designing websites? That was for hackers in movies! But fate had other plans.

One of my friends was studying Computer Science, and he absolutely hated writing his lab records. Being the kind soul I am (*okay, maybe he bribed me with food*), I took up the task. As I copied his notes, I saw all these cool things—**HTML tags, CSS styles, colorful fonts**—and my curiosity kicked in. "Wait… how does this actually work?" I asked him. He shrugged and said, *"Check out W3Schools."*

And that, my friends, was my **rabbit hole moment**. 🕳️🐇

## The First Steps – W3Schools & YouTube 🎬

I opened W3Schools and saw my first HTML lesson. I changed text colors, added headings, and suddenly, I felt like a *coding magician* ✨. It was so much fun! But then… CSS came along, and I was like, *why is my button running away from me?* 😭

Just when I started doubting my life choices, I went back to my native place, where my **brother** had also started learning web development. So, we teamed up—**he had a sharper mind, but I had unstoppable consistency**. Together, we learned from YouTube tutorials, failing miserably at times (*hello, missing semicolons*), but we kept going.

To this day, I'm thankful for all those YouTube instructors who saved me from throwing my laptop out the window. 🤣

## The Struggle of Switching Careers 💼➡️💻

Switching to web development from a different background wasn’t easy.

There were times when I felt stuck, overwhelmed, and frustrated. *"Why do I need a semicolon? Why won’t my CSS flexbox just flex?!"* But I kept going. And that’s what I want to share with you—**a clear, step-by-step path** so you don’t feel lost like I did.
