**こんにちは、みなさん！(Konnichiwa, minasan!)**  
Today was a peaceful and quiet day. Our sensei was unwell, so our Japanese class didn’t happen. But learning never stops, right? 😊  
So I decided to **revise everything I learned so far** and practice something new — **how to introduce myself and my beautiful joint family in Japanese**. 💕

Later in the day, I also started reading **“Three Thousand Stitches” by Sudha Murty** — a touching collection of real-life stories. I’ll tell you more at the end of the blog.

### 🏠 **My Family Introduction – 私のかぞくのしょうかい (Watashi no kazoku no shoukai)**

### 📖 **Book of the Day – “Three Thousand Stitches” by Sudha Murty**

Today, after finishing my revision, I picked up a new book — **Three Thousand Stitches**. This book is heartwarming and eye-opening. Each story is short but filled with wisdom, kindness, and real Indian values. I just started it, but I can tell — it’s going to be a good one. 💛

If you’re feeling stuck or tired, pick this book. It’s not only inspiring but feels like sitting with a grandma who shares life stories over a cup of chai. ☕

### 🌸 **Final Words – One Day at a Time**

Learning Japanese with daily life is tough — cooking, cleaning, office work — and still trying to learn alphabets and new phrases. But what I’ve learned is:

> “Don’t be too hard on yourself. One step every day matters.”

So I’ll keep going. Even if I can’t do much, I’ll keep **revising**, keep **practicing**, and keep **learning**.

📌 Today’s words of the day:  
**まだまだ です (Made made desu)** = I still have a long way to go.

ありがとう ございます！またね！  
**~ Richa (りちゃ)**
