Hello guys! 👋

It has been quite some time since I focused on the tech side of things with my last post on the blog. Work has been extremely busy, and today, I wanted to share a bit about my journey at **Capgemini**. Although I’ve only recently joined, there are already several things that make me feel excited and grateful to be part of this organization.

### 🌱 **Opportunities for Learning and Growth**

One of the greatest benefits of working at Capgemini is the **richness of learning resources** 📚. They are incredibly generous with training sessions and offer free courses on platforms like **Udemy**, **Coursera**, and their extensive internal library, **Ocean**. I’m sure I’ve only scratched the surface, but it’s motivating to know that these resources are there, supporting us in our growth. Capgemini clearly values the development of its workforce and invests in helping employees upskill.

### 🚀 **Challenges That Drive Development**

Of course, this doesn’t mean everything is easy—there are plenty of challenges! 💪 The work can be demanding and often comes with a steep learning curve. However, each challenge presents an opportunity to learn. Coming from smaller firms, I wasn’t familiar with some of the processes and tools here, but the **supportive environment** has made a huge difference. If you need assistance, you’ll find **amazing people** willing to guide and collaborate, which fosters a strong sense of teamwork and growth.

### 💻 **Free Time? More Learning!**

Currently, I’m assigned to a project that keeps me busy, but I make use of my free time to continue learning and developing new skills 🎓. Coming from a place where accessing quality education was challenging, I feel incredibly **privileged** to have these resources at my fingertips. Capgemini’s approach has motivated me to make the most of these opportunities, and I feel fortunate to have them.

### 🌏 **A Suggestion to Make a Difference**

One thing I’d like to suggest to Capgemini’s leadership team is to consider **extending some of these learning resources** to government colleges, particularly in places like Bihar, where I come from 🇮🇳. There are many talented students there who, despite facing challenges in accessing quality education, have a **strong desire to learn and grow**. With the right resources and support, they could achieve great things.

If given the chance, I’d love to dedicate some of my time to **training students in technology skills**—especially those who may not have access to this kind of education.
