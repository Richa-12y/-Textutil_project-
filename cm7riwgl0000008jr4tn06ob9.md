## üå± **Basic CSS Questions**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is CSS, and why is it used?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements, define layouts, colors, fonts, and animations, making web pages visually appealing.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the different types of CSS?

* **Inline CSS:** Applied directly within an element using the `style` attribute.
    
* **Internal CSS:** Written inside a `<style>` tag in the HTML file.
    
* **External CSS:** Stored in a separate `.css` file and linked using `<link>` in HTML.
    

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Explain the Box Model in CSS.

The Box Model consists of:

* **Content** (text, images)
    
* **Padding** (space around content)
    
* **Border** (around padding)
    
* **Margin** (space outside the border)
    

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky` positioning?

* **Relative:** Positioned relative to its normal position.
    
* **Absolute:** Positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor.
    
* **Fixed:** Stays at the same place on the screen, even on scroll.
    
* **Sticky:** Switches between relative and fixed based on scroll position.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ How do you center a div using CSS?

Using Flexbox:

```

Using Grid:

```css
display: grid;
place-items: center;
height: 100vh;
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ What are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements?

* **Pseudo-classes** (e.g., `:hover`, `:nth-child(n)`) target elements based on state or position.
    
* **Pseudo-elements** (e.g., `::before`, `::after`) style parts of an element.
    

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What are media queries?

Media queries make websites responsive by applying styles based on screen size.

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```
