Let’s be real.

Today is Day 10 of my Japanese learning journey. Double digits. A mini milestone. I should be celebrating with kanji drills, grammar practice, and maybe a matcha latte. Instead, I’m curled up in bed, feeling like I got body-slammed by a cold. My brain is foggy, my energy is missing, and my motivation is somewhere under the blanket with me, refusing to get up.

But here's the twist—I \*still\* showed up.

Ten days ago, I made a promise to myself:

1\. Study Japanese every day.

2\. Write about it every day.

Not just when it's easy. Not just when life cooperates. But every single day. Even the messy, unproductive, "I feel like trash" days. Especially those.

\### The Reality of Learning (a.k.a. The Not-So-Aesthetic Days)

We love to picture language learning as this beautiful, aesthetic routine—morning coffee, neat notebooks, Japanese podcasts in the background while we highlight vocab in pastel colors. But learning anything real involves a lot of chaos. Missed sessions. Rough days. Mental blocks. And yes—sometimes being sick and barely functioning.

Today I couldn’t study properly. I didn’t open a textbook. I didn’t review kanji. I didn’t write a single hiragana character.

But I listened.

I played a Japanese audio while I rested. I didn’t understand every word, but I let the rhythm of the language wrap around me. I caught a few words. Maybe I misheard half of them, but they were there. Floating around my brain like stubborn little particles refusing to leave.

That’s enough for today.

\### Why This Still Counts

I’m writing this not because I studied hard, but because I didn’t give up. Consistency doesn’t mean perfection. It means not quitting, even when the ideal version of the day falls apart. I didn’t do much today—but I did \*something\*.

I think that matters more than we give it credit for.

Tomorrow, I’ll be back. Stronger. More focused. Less congested, hopefully. I’ll get back to the grammar, the writing, the real studying. I’ll give a proper update on what I’m learning and how it’s going.

But today? Today I learned that discipline sometimes looks like lying in bed with headphones in, showing up for your goal even when you’d rather not move.

So, to anyone else trying to learn something and having a rough day: you’re not falling behind. You’re building grit. And that’s part of the process too.

Thanks for sticking with me. Let’s see what Day 11 brings.
