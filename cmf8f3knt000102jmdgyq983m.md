I remember it like it was yesterday. My grandmother, a woman whose life seemed to be a series of silent prayers and selfless devotion, would sit on the kitchen floor, sorting grains of rice. She'd hum old bhajans, her voice soft and melodic. For her, every chore, every meal, every day was an act of worship. She was the spiritual core of our home, the one who kept the traditions alive, the one who knew the right time for every ritual.

Then there was my grandfather. He was a kind, gentle man who would go to the temple on Tuesdays, offer his respects, and come back. But at home, the spiritual work—the prayers, the fasting, the preparing of prasad—was always left to her. He would simply enjoy the peaceful, divine atmosphere she created.

As a child, I saw this and thought nothing of it. This was normal. This was how things were. But as I grew up, a tiny, uncomfortable thought started to form in my mind: **If God is for everyone, why is all the spiritual responsibility placed on her, and not on him?** Why does society tell women they are the protectors of dharma, but then treat men as if their spirituality is optional?

This isn't a new thought. I've seen it in countless Indian homes. It's an unwritten rule, a silent contract. The women are the keepers of faith, while the men are merely beneficiaries of it. This double standard is everywhere, and the more I think about it, the more I realize it's hurting us all.

### The Burden of Blind Faith and Missing Knowledge 📚

When we say women are the "protectors of our culture," what exactly does that mean? Does it mean simply following rituals without understanding them?

I’ve met so many incredible women who fast, pray, and perform elaborate pujas with an unwavering devotion. But if you ask them *why* they do it, the answer is often, "Because my mother did it," or "That's just what we do." There's no malice in this, just a deep-seated acceptance of tradition.

Most of them were never encouraged to read our scriptures. They were taught to cook for festivals, to clean for pujas, but not to read the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, or the Vedas. It's like being asked to protect a priceless library, but you’re only allowed to dust the books, not read them.

How can anyone truly protect a religion or a culture if they don't understand its root, its philosophy, and its profound wisdom? When our children, curious and full of questions, ask us the meaning behind a festival or a ritual, what do we say? When the knowledge is missing, all we can offer is a blank stare or a generic, unconvincing answer. This is not protecting our culture; it's creating a barrier for the next generation. It makes our beautiful traditions seem like a set of meaningless, outdated rules, not a rich tapestry of wisdom.

### The Contradiction That Hurts 💔

The irony of it all is infuriating. Women are expected to do all the groundwork of spiritual life—the fasting, the cleaning, the food preparation—but when it comes to the main event, the actual puja with a pandit, they are often told they can't do it . They want man.

I’ve seen women who have fasted for days, tirelessly cleaned the entire house, and prepared a feast, only to be told, "Your husband must sit for the puja." It's as if their devotion and hard work are only valid when a man’s presence "blesses" the ritual.

If we are the protectors, why aren't we trusted enough to stand in the front line? This contradiction shows the two-faced nature of our society. It's a slap in the face of every woman who has ever dedicated her life to keeping our traditions alive. We are strong enough to carry the burden, but not strong enough to lead the prayer.

### A Shared Journey, A Shared Home 🏡

Another thought that always lingers is about God’s presence. Many people, especially men, seem to think that God is only present in a temple, a holy place, or a large religious gathering. They go there, feel a moment of peace, and then return home, leaving their spirituality at the temple doors.

<mark>But isn't God everywhere? In your home, in your heart, in the simple act of being kind to a stranger?</mark>

Spirituality isn’t about showing the world how devout you are by going to a temple. It's about a sincere, consistent practice, whether you're alone in a quiet room or surrounded by your family. When spirituality becomes a shared journey, it becomes a powerful force for good in the family.

Children learn by observation, not by lectures. If they see their father sitting disinterestedly while their mother performs all the rituals, what are we teaching them? We are teaching them that spirituality is a "woman's job." We are raising a generation that will delegate their spiritual life, just as they would delegate a chore.

The truth is, men need peace, happiness, and a connection to the divine just as much as women do. So why should only one gender be responsible for fostering that connection?

### A Call for Balance, Not Blame ✨

This blog post is not a fight between men and women. It's a call for balance. It’s a plea for both men and women to walk this spiritual path together.

Let’s stop handing down blind traditions and start sharing true knowledge. Let’s encourage our sons to read the scriptures just as we encourage our daughters. Let’s make our homes places of shared worship, where both parents lead by example.

Protecting our dharma is not about gender. It is about understanding, practicing, and living by the values that make our traditions beautiful. It is about knowledge, sincerity, and a shared responsibility.

So, I leave this question for you, for all of us: **Do you want to simply follow traditions, or do you want to understand them and pass on true wisdom to the next generation?**

Because if we want our culture to thrive, we must stop creating blind followers and start raising true protectors of dharma.
