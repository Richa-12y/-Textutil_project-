**Konnichiwa, minna-san!** 🙏  
Today was one of those days where responsibilities kept me busy—but I'm still proud I stayed committed to my Japanese learning journey. 💪📘

After finishing up my work 💻, I cooked a quick meal 🍲, cleaned my room 🧹, had dinner 🍱, and finally sat down with my books. I didn’t have hours to spare, but the time I *did* spend—was full of focus and intention.

### 🔄 Today's Revision & Mindset

As always, I revised both my **Hiragana** and **Katakana** charts. Why?  
Because this week… my mentor told us we’ll be having a test! 😱✍️  
I’m a little nervous, but I’m determined to give it my best. 💯

Even though it feels like there’s still so much to learn, I’ve accepted that this journey will take time. Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither is language mastery!

In Japanese, we say:

> **まだまだです (Made made desu)**  
> *Still a long way to go.*

But I believe with consistency and patience, I’ll get there. And so will you. 💖

### 🧩 Extra Practice Tool

my mentor shared a really fun and useful site for practicing alphabets in a playful way:

🔗 [https://kana.pro/](https://kana.pro/)  
I highly recommend it for both Hiragana and Katakana drills. It makes learning a game—and who doesn’t love that?

### 💭 Final Thought

Some days are heavy. Some days are light.  
But what matters is that I keep showing up. I may be tired, but I’m committed.  
Language is not just about memorizing—it’s about showing up for yourself every day. 🌸

So yes, it’s **Day 8**, and I’m still going strong.  
**がんばります！(Ganbarimasu!)** – I’ll do my best!  
**おやすみなさい (Oyasuminasai)** – Good night. 😴🌙

**ありがとう ございます! またね!**
