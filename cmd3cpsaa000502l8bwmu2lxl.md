**By Richa – Back on Track (with Chai, Laptop & Life Lessons)**

---

You know what?  
Today was *one of those days*. Long hours, drained brain, screens everywhere… I genuinely told myself:

> “Let’s skip the blog today. No one will notice. I’ll write tomorrow.”

But then another voice inside me whispered back:

> “You promised yourself this. Not the internet. Not your followers. *Yourself.*”

So, I shut down that unnecessary inner voice—the lazy one, the excuse maker.  
I grabbed my laptop, sat in my cozy spot, and decided: *“Let’s write. Let’s stay consistent. Let’s keep the promise.”*

This week, I made a small deal with myself—write one blog post every day on the books I’ve read. Next week, I’ll return to tech blogs. But this? This is for the *soul reset*. For me. And maybe for *you*, if you’ve been needing a gentle reminder that you matter.

## 📚 Book of the Day: *Good Vibes, Good Life* by Vex King

This book felt like a hug on paper.  
No jargon. No heavy philosophies. Just simple truths and gentle wake-up calls, wrapped in real-life examples.

Vex King shares his journey from pain to purpose—growing up in a tough environment, facing racism, financial instability, and emotional trauma. But despite all that, he didn’t just survive—he *elevated*.

This book is about **how to protect your energy**, love yourself, and let go of what doesn’t align with your peace.

### ☁️ The Real Talk We All Need Sometimes

Let’s be honest—most of us know we should think positively, treat ourselves better, and avoid toxic people. But life isn’t always that simple. Vex knows that. That’s why the book isn’t preachy—it’s relatable.

He gently walks you through things like:

* Why **self-love is not selfish**
    
* How to **raise your vibration** when everything feels heavy
    
* Why we attract certain people, and how to stop repeating patterns
    
* The power of **affirmations** (and how to make them actually work)
    
* Setting **boundaries** without guilt
    

> “Your vibe attracts your tribe.”  
> Simple line. Deep truth.

This book helped me reflect on **what energy I bring into rooms**, how I speak to myself, and how I react when things go wrong.

### 💡 Small Examples That Hit Hard

* When you talk negatively about yourself, your subconscious believes it. That’s why your inner dialogue *matters*.
    
* If someone treats you badly repeatedly, it’s not just about *them*—it’s also about what you’ve allowed. Boundaries = self-respect.
    
* You can’t expect flowers to bloom in toxic soil. The same goes for dreams in an unhealthy mindset.
    

> “You deserve to be loved by the person you see in the mirror.”

That one hit deep.

### 🧘‍♀️ My Honest Take

As a developer, I often focus on logic, problem-solving, productivity. But Vex reminded me that **peace is not a luxury—it’s a need**.

Yes, we can build apps and meet deadlines. But what about building *ourselves*?

This book didn’t change me overnight. But it made me **pause**. It softened my inner critic. It reminded me to protect my energy. And today, when I almost didn’t show up for my blog—I remembered what I read.

So I wrote. And I’m proud of that.
