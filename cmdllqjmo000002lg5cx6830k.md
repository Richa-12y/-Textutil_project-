**Konnichiwa, minna-san!** ☀️ Happy Sunday! Today was a truly refreshing day for me—no work, full of rest and joy. I had a good sleep, ate yummy food 🍱, and cleaned my house including my little puja room 🛕. With a peaceful mind, I jumped straight into my Japanese studies, and here’s what I accomplished!

### 🔄 Revision + New Learning

* ✅ I revised my **Hiragana** charts and sounds
    
* ✅ I started and **completed the entire Katakana** set today! 🎉
    

At first, I was a bit nervous about Katakana because many people say it’s tricky. And yes, some characters like **<mark>シ (shi), ツ (tsu), ソ (so), and ン (n)</mark>** can look confusing at first glance 😵‍💫. But with repeated practice, I’m beginning to feel more confident.

### 🧾 My Cheat Sheet Plan:

I’m planning to **print out both Hiragana and Katakana charts** 🖨️ and stick them on my wall 📌 so I can keep reviewing them daily. This way, I won’t forget what I’ve learned even after a busy workday.

I want to give a shoutout to my mentor—she’s a bit strict but amazing 💡. She’s assigning us **quizzes and exercises**, which help me stay on track and take learning seriously. Right after writing this blog, I’ll complete my homework too. 📝
