\*\*Konnichiwa, minna-san!\*\*

Today wasn’t about sitting with books or typing new vocabulary into my notes.

It was about living — doing chores, taking care of my home, my health, and still staying connected to my learning journey.

\### 🛍️ My Day in a Glance

Today I went to \*\*WeMart\*\*, did a \*\*big grocery haul\*\* for the whole month — bought dry fruits, oil, rice, and all the daily essentials 🍚🥜🥦. I love how organized that store is!

After coming back, I didn’t take rest — nope!

I cleaned my house from top to bottom, did \*\*washroom cleaning\*\*, organized my kitchen, and even managed to clean myself up too! 🧽🛁

Yes, it was tiring. But that fresh home feeling? Totally worth it.

And guess what? Amid all this, I kept repeating my \*\*self-introduction\*\* lines in Japanese.

Even when I'm doing something else, I try to keep the words floating in my mind — that’s the trick to building muscle memory in language!

\### 👋 My Basic Self-Intro in Japanese

Here’s how I’ve learned to introduce myself:

\* こんにちは、はじめまして。

\*\*Konnichiwa, hajimemashite.\*\*

Hello, nice to meet you.

\* わたしは りちゃ です。

\*\*Watashi wa Richa desu.\*\*

I am Richa.

\* インドからきました。

\*\*Indo kara kimashita.\*\*

I’m from India.

\* ２５さいです。

\*\*Nijuugo-sai desu.\*\*

I’m 25 years old.

\* ソフトウェア・エンジニアです。

\*\*Sofutowea enjinia desu.\*\*

I’m a software engineer.

\* よろしくおねがいします。

\*\*Yoroshiku onegaishimasu.\*\*

Please treat me well (Nice to meet you).

These few lines are a great way to start any conversation. And even though I was scrubbing tiles and folding groceries today, I kept practicing them — whispering them like a mantra 😄

\### 🌿 My Little Note to You

Some days will be super productive, some days will be all about rest.

And then there are days like today — where \*\*life becomes the classroom\*\*.

Whether it’s practicing Japanese while cooking or revising self-intro while cleaning… it all counts. You’re showing up. And that’s what matters.

So if you’re learning too — keep it light, keep it real, and keep going. 🌈

またね！(Matane!)

ありがとう ございます！(Arigatou gozaimasu!)

Richa (りちゃ)
