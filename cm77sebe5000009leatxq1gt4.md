## My HTML Interview Struggles üò≠

When I started learning web development, I was excited about HTML & CSS. I built a ton of static websites, adding cool fonts and colors. But there was one thing I *didn't* focus on ‚Äì **interview preparation**. And that came back to bite me!

![Proxify_io coding remote work developers programmers GIF](https://media4.giphy.com/media/8TlYK09XqfMlRZpBXw/200.gif?cid=ecf05e4729nw6j4hpasbg2k513xhh5jidyx8xo3zemv4h4wg&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=200.gif&ct=g align="center")

I remember my first HTML interview vividly. The interviewer asked, **<mark>‚ÄúWhich DOCTYPE are we using?‚Äù</mark>** and **<mark>‚ÄúWhat is a semantic tag?‚Äù</mark>** I completely blanked out. The funny part? I had used those tags in my projects but had no clue what they were actually called! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

That experience taught me a **valuable lesson**: knowing how to build websites is not enough ‚Äì you need to be able to explain what you're doing in an interview.

So today, I‚Äôm sharing **all the essential HTML questions** that will help you ace your interviews. **Trust me,** preparing for these will save you from the panic I felt. üòÖ

![](https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExbms2ZmEyMWphenBqOWQybGRmMTFndDJ5NWo0ZjZ0Znpuc2wyY3dsZCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/UcK7JalnjCz0k/giphy.gif align="left")

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is HTML?

**Answer:** HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of the web. It structures content using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and lists.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ What is DOCTYPE in HTML?

**Answer:** DOCTYPE declares the HTML version being used in the document. The latest version is:

```xml
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This tells the browser that we are using **HTML5**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ What are semantic tags in HTML?

**Answer:** Semantic tags give meaning to the structure of a webpage. Examples include:

* `<header>` ‚Äì Represents the page‚Äôs header
    
* `<nav>` ‚Äì Defines navigation links
    
* `<article>` ‚Äì Represents self-contained content
    
* `<footer>` ‚Äì Defines footer content
    
* `<section>` ‚Äì Groups related content together
    

These help search engines and developers understand the content better.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between `<div>` and `<span>`?

**Answer:**

* `<div>` is a **block-level** element used for grouping multiple elements.
    
* `<span>` is an **inline** element used for styling small parts of text.
    

Example:

```xml
<div style="background-color: yellow;">This is a div</div>
<span style="color: red;">This is a span</span>
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ What are meta tags in HTML?

**Answer:** Meta tags provide metadata about a webpage. Example:

```xml
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="Learn HTML interview questions">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between `<strong>` and `<b>`, `<em>` and `<i>`?

**Answer:**

* `<strong>` and `<b>` both make text bold, but `<strong>` has semantic meaning for importance.
    
* `<em>` and `<i>` both italicize text, but `<em>` gives emphasis.
    

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ What are self-closing tags?

**Answer:** Self-closing tags don‚Äôt need a closing tag. Examples:

```xml
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter text">
<hr>
```

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between absolute and relative links?

**Answer:**

* **Absolute link:** Full URL including domain (e.g., `https://example.com/about.html`)
    
* **Relative link:** Only the file path relative to the current page (e.g., `about.html`)
    

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between `<ul>` and `<ol>`?

**Answer:**

* `<ul>` (unordered list) creates bullet points.
    
* `<ol>` (ordered list) creates a numbered list.
    

Example:

```xml
<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>First Step</li>
  <li>Second Step</li>
</ol>
```

### üîü What is the difference between `id` and `class`?

**Answer:**

* `id` is unique and used for a single element (`id="header"`)
    
* `class` can be used on multiple elements (`class="btn"`)
    

Example:

```xml
<div id="header">Unique Header</div>
<button class="btn">Click me</button>
```

## üöÄ My Advice for HTML Interview Prep

![Computer Love GIF](https://media0.giphy.com/media/IbaHSmEeJGqk/200.gif?cid=790b7611xhg276v6ycq3ewznyqedlmk4rnblu7sre4uexz39&ep=v1_gifs_search&rid=200.gif&ct=g align="center")

üëâ **Don‚Äôt just build websites, prepare for interviews too!** After creating projects, spend time reviewing common interview questions. üëâ **Make your own notes in your own words.** This will help you remember better. üëâ **Understand the concepts, don‚Äôt just memorize definitions.** If the interviewer is an old-school type, they may want textbook answers, but modern interviews focus on understanding. üëâ **Practice explaining concepts out loud.** Teaching someone (or pretending to) helps reinforce learning.

Need **1-on-1 interview guidance** or **mock interviews**? I‚Äôd love to help! üòä
